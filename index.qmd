## Overview of the Bioinformatics Training Programme

The training programme, an initiative out of Genomics Aotearoa, aims to upskill the research community of Aotearoa in the rapidly growing field of bioinformatics.

Training is offered through a portfolio of free, interactive workshops instructed by experts in the field. Workshop material ranges from basic coding for beginners to highly advanced, specialised workflows.

Since it's inception in 2019, Genomics Aotearoa's training programme has hosted 76 workshops reaching 1477 participants.
